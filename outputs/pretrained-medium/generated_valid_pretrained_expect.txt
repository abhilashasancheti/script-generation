As it's become harder to keep warm in hot, humid climate, many Americans eat only one to two meals a day, and many of them don't do it at all. In one study, researchers from Texas A&M found that only about five percent of those eating more than four meals per day were eating at least four times a week. That leaves about 10 percent who are eating less than three meals per day and are only "moderate" eaters, according to the study.

these are the things that you can expect while repairing a flat bicycle tire:

• Reducing friction between the wheel and wheel hub. Wheel bearings may lose some of their grip while the tire is on the ground. If that happens, it can cause the wheel to drop or stop in the street.

• Decreasing air flow between the wheel and the tire. This reduces tire compression and decreases wheel travel.

• A loosening of the tire's rubber. This causes the wheel to break up.

• Slippage during the ride. As the tires roll off the ground, the air pressure inside them increases, and the wheel begins to slide.

• An increase in friction between the wheel and tire. When the tire is riding, the friction between the wheel and the wheel hub make

Rocks should not be rubbed into the wheel. If the wheel is scratched, sand it, clean it, and re-apply a new wheel.

Lubricants should be carefully applied to all areas of the tire including sidewalls. Some lubricants may not help if you use a new tire.
